# Documentation

The NVDA developer toolkit assists blind and visually impaired developers with the difficult task of creating appealing visual layouts for any software or web development project. It does this by providing the following about an object or control:

## Object location (in pixels)

*   left edge
*   top edge
*   right edge
*   bottom edge
*   top-left corner
*   top-right corner
*   bottom-left corner
*   bottom-right corner
*   absolute center
*   height
*   width

## Browser compatibility

Developer tools will work with Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer. However, to make developer tools work well with Chrome and Internet Explorer, you must add the following at the top of all CSS files: * {box-sizing: box-border; }. This allows Chrome and Internet Explorer to include borders, padding, and element content as part of the element's total size. Failure to heed this warning will result in random and unexpected results.

## Keyboard shortcuts

The developer toolkit makes use of the keyboard combination CONTROL+WINDOWS as its modifyer key. Any shortcuts listed must include the toolkit modifyer key to work properly
