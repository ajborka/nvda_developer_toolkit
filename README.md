# nvda_developer_toolkit
The NVDA developer toolkit assists blind and visually impaired developers with the difficult task of creating appealing visual layouts for any software or web development project. Currently, it provides the location of objects on the visible portion of the screen. The addon provides the location in pixels. The anchor for each object is the top left corner in relation to the top left corner of the window or screen. For example, if the addon reports left: 15, top: 100, this means that the object with focus is 15 pixels from the left edge of the screen and 100 pixels from the top edge of the screen. The width and height of the control is also provided in pixels. This accounts for the content, padding, and margins of each control involved.
