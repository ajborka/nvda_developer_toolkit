# Developer toolkit

Web developer tools that assist blind and visually impaired web developers with creating appealing web pages without the help of a sighted person. The addon only works in Firefox at this time because Mozilla provides the most complete implementation of the accessibility tree. Other browsers may be added in future updates. To enable or disable Developer toolkit features, go to the NVDA menu (NVDA+N)/Preferences/Developer toolkit and check the enable developer toolkit features checkbox, then press the OK button. Developer toolkit features can also be enabled and disabled by pressing alt+windows+k while in a Firefox browser window.
